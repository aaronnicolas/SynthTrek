            Welcome to SynthTrek
        </h1>
        <p>
            Step into the ever-changing world of Synth Trek, a thrilling 3D roguelite adventure where every decision could be your last. 
            Starting at the base of a mysterious pyramid, you’ll face procedurally generated levels and enemies directed by a powerful 
            digital companion app. Inspired by Dungeon and Dragons, Synth Trek fuses dice-based combat with modern strategy, allowing you 
            to master a variety of classes, each with unique abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Will you team up with allies to survive, or race to the top and claim victory for yourself? With unexpected challenges around 
            every corner, the journey is as unpredictable as it is dangerous. Do you have what it takes to conquer the pyramid and outsmart 
            your foes?
        </p>
        <p>
            The trek begins now—survive, adapt, and emerge victorious.
